# Hi, I'm Manu 👋

**Builder | Operator | Problem Solver**

I build and ship products that solve real problems. My approach combines technical depth, data-driven decision making, and structured execution frameworks to turn ideas into working solutions.

## 🚀 What I Build

### [PACKD](https://github.com/manumarri-sudo/PACKD) — Expert Knowledge Distribution Platform
*Registry and toolchain for AI domain expertise*

**Impact**: Enable developers to package and share domain expertise like npm packages
- Built three-layer architecture (MCP + Reasoning + Skills) for composability
- Designed developer-first CLI for rapid adoption
- Created validation system and local runtime infrastructure

**Tech**: Python, Model Context Protocol, DSPy | **Status**: Core platform shipped

---

### [Capture](https://github.com/manumarri-sudo/capture) — Knowledge Management System
*Chrome extension + web dashboard for multi-project organization*

**Impact**: Reduce information retrieval time from hours to seconds
- Designed one-click capture workflow across all web platforms
- Built intelligent auto-categorization using URL pattern recognition
- Implemented full-text search with PostgreSQL
- **Key Metric**: 95% extension completion, 85% dashboard shipped

**Tech**: TypeScript, Next.js, Chrome APIs, Supabase | **Status**: Beta

---

### [Cultural Canvas](https://github.com/manumarri-sudo/cultural-canvas) — AI Content Platform
*Culturally authentic design generation at scale*

**Impact**: 10x faster design creation vs. manual methods
- Integrated AI generation with market intelligence (Google Trends, Instagram, Pinterest)
- Built human-in-the-loop approval workflow for quality control
- Automated marketplace listing creation and mockup generation
- **Key Metrics**: <3min for 5 designs, >40% approval rate target, 90% cost reduction

**Tech**: Python/Flask, FLUX AI, Etsy API | **Status**: Production

---

### [ChronoDebug](https://github.com/manumarri-sudo/Chronodebug) — LLM Debugging Tool
*Developer tool for reproducing production AI issues*

**Impact**: Reduce bug reproduction time from hours to <2 minutes
- Designed privacy-first architecture (local replay, no third-party data)
- Built deterministic replay system using OpenAI seed parameters
- Created SDK with zero-latency impact on production requests
- **Key Metrics**: <1ms overhead, 95%+ replay accuracy

**Tech**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Next.js | **Status**: Core shipped

## 💡 How I Approach Problems

### 1. **Problem Definition**
- Start with user research and pain point validation
- Quantify the problem (time wasted, cost, frequency)
- Define success metrics before building

### 2. **Solution Design**
- Evaluate multiple approaches with trade-off analysis
- Design for composability and future extensibility
- Prioritize based on impact vs. effort

### 3. **Structured Execution**
- Break complex projects into phased rollouts
- Ship iteratively with user feedback loops
- Track metrics to validate assumptions

### 4. **Data-Driven Decisions**
- Define KPIs upfront (engagement, performance, business)
- Use A/B testing and experimentation where applicable
- Let data guide feature prioritization

## 🛠 Technical Capabilities

**Languages**: Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, SQL
**Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Chrome Extensions
**Backend**: FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, PostgreSQL
**AI/ML**: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, Model Context Protocol, DSPy, FLUX
**Infrastructure**: Vercel, Supabase, Docker, Git
**Data**: PostgreSQL, Full-text search, Analytics

## 📊 Frameworks I Use

**Product Thinking:**
- Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) for problem discovery
- North Star metrics for focus
- ICE scoring (Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort) for prioritization

**Execution:**
- Phased rollouts with clear success criteria
- Retrospectives for continuous improvement
- Documentation-driven development

**Analytics:**
- Funnel analysis for conversion optimization
- Cohort analysis for retention
- Performance monitoring (latency, error rates)

## 📈 What I Track

**User Engagement**: DAU/MAU, retention curves, feature adoption rates
**Technical Performance**: API latency, error rates, system uptime
**Business Impact**: Conversion rates, user growth, cost efficiency
**Quality**: User satisfaction, support volume, bug resolution time

## 🎯 My Principles

1. **Ship Fast, Learn Faster** — Iterate with real user feedback
2. **Data Over Opinions** — Measure everything, let metrics guide decisions
3. **Think in Systems** — Build for composability and long-term scalability
4. **User Empathy First** — Solve real problems, not imagined ones
5. **Transparent Communication** — Clear documentation, honest trade-offs

## 🔍 Recent Achievements

- Built and shipped **4 production-grade products** across different domains
- Designed **privacy-first architectures** for sensitive data handling
- Created **developer tools** with <1ms overhead and 95%+ reliability
- Implemented **AI integrations** with market intelligence systems
- Shipped **Chrome extension** with universal capture functionality
